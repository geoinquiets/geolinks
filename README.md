This is a website to share the main links that point to my Internet presence. You can check it at <https://links.jorgesanz.net/>.

Technically, this is a minimal website hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) and using [Parcel](https://v2.parceljs.org/) for zero configuration deployment. Check the [`package.json`](./package.json) file for details.

If you have any feedback or comment, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/jsanz/links/issues/new) or use my [contact form](https://jorgesanz.net/contact/). Have a great day!
